# Yolo Web App

# Conventions
Variables are camelCased.
File and folder names start with small letters eg: "routes/home.js"
For custom styling (i.e. not using bootstrap) class names for elements must be snake_cased and prefixed by the folder and file name eg: "route_home_button". This is because all css files and jsx files are bundled together when the app is built.
